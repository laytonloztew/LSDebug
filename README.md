# LSDebug
A lua script for Bizhawk that superimposes a community-made "debug menu" onto LSD: Dream Emulator.
![An example of the debug menu in action. The player is in Kyoto, on Day 1, and their graph position is (2, 0).](https://github.com/xen-0sd/LSDebug/blob/main/example1.png)
![The same example, notated to show what each part of the menu displays.](https://github.com/xen-0sd/LSDebug/blob/main/example2.png)

# Controls
LSDebug can not only read from the game, it can mess with it too:
- ↕ | Change the dreamer's X position
- ↔ | Change the dreamer's Y position
- SPACE/CTRL | Change the dreamer's Z position
- I/O | Change the "factor" (how much each button press will change a value)
- Q/E | Change the current day (only takes effect when entering a new field)
