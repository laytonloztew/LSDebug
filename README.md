# LSDebug
A lua script for Bizhawk that superimposes a community-made "debug menu" onto emulations of LSD: Dream Emulator.
![An example of the debug menu in action. The player is in Kyoto, on Day 1, and their graph position is (2, 0).](https://github.com/xen-0sd/LSDebug/blob/main/example1.png)
![The same example, notated to show what each part of the menu displays.](https://github.com/xen-0sd/LSDebug/blob/main/example2.png)
